# PaymentSystem
Contracts to enable fast POS payments through use of non-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges.

This ecosystem was developed within the frames of bachelor thesis work in TalTech.
"BRIDGING DIGITAL ASSETS TO TRADITIONAL FINANCE: DECENTRALIZED POINT OF SALE CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENTS" is a bachelor thesis paper written by Johan Valge during the course of Integrated Engineering at TalTech.
The ecosystem consists of author created smart contracts, OpenZeppelin contracts, UniSwap (HoneySwap fork) contracts and Chainlink price feeds.

"PaymentSystem.sol" is the main contract of the ecosystem, written by the author.
"LivePrice.sol" is a slightly customized helper contract for accessing ChainLink price feeds on the "PaymentSystem.sol" contract.
"FullCodeFileOfPaymentSystem.sol" is the combined contract of all modular smart contracts used for the ecosystem. This file was used for deployment on xDai mainnet.
